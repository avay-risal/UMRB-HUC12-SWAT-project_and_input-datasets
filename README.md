# UMRB-HUC12-SWAT-project_and_input-datasets
This repository hosts a modified version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), named SWAT-UMRB-HUC12, which integrates the Century-based carbon and nutrient cycling algorithms and includes adaptations for forest ecosystems. The model is applied at the HUC12 subbasin scale across the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB).​

The repository provides:​

The customized SWAT model setup.

Calibrated parameter sets and their ranges.

Statistical summaries comparing observed and simulated data for ET, LAI, and NPP.

Time series visualizations for different land-use types.

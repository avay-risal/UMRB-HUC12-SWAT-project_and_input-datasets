# SWAT-UMRB-HUC12: Enhanced HUC12 SWAT Model Project and input dataset for the Upper Mississippi River Basin

This repository provides a modified version of the SWAT modelâ€”**SWAT-UMRB-HUC12**â€”that incorporates the CENTURY-based carbon and nutrient cycling module and adaptations tailored for forest ecosystems. The model and datasets are designed for watershed-scale ecohydrological simulation and validation across agricultural lands, forests, and grasslands in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB).

## ðŸ”— Repository Overview

The `main` branch contains:
- The modified SWAT executable (`SWAT-UMRB-HUC12.exe`)
- Input datasets and calibrated parameter files
- Performance metrics (RÂ², NSE, PBIAS) for ET, LAI, and NPP
- Time series plots for model-observation comparisons
- Land-use specific summaries (agriculture, forest, grassland)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features

- **Land-use specific calibration:** ET, LAI, and NPP evaluated separately for croplands, forests, and grasslands
- **Improved realism for forest ecosystems** using forest-sensitive carbon/nutrient cycling
- **Comprehensive statistical summaries** across all UMRB subbasins
- **Open access data** for reproducibility and further research

## ðŸ§ª How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Use the provided executable `SWAT-UMRB-HUC12.exe` and rename it to SWAT.exe before placing it in SWAT TxInOutfolder.
3. Use the statistical summaries and time series data to analyze model performance.
4. Refer to the `par_inf.txt` file for parameter ranges during calibration.
